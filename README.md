# README-generator

## Description

**Goal**: To create a quick way to create a README for a project with all the necessary information.

As developers, our projects are seen by many other developers. We have README's to explain the details and funtionality of our projects and to create a line of communication between the project developers and other developers who are interested in said project. Writing README's can be time consuming, and in a field focused on efficiency, it is important to take time consuming tasks, and make them quicker and easier for ourselves. With this command-line application, we are able to focus on the content of the README, and our content will be formatted neatly and effectively in the genereated README.
